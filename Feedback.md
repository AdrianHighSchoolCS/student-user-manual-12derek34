## Feedback
<p>I prefer to receive feedback: (face to face or in writing or other) any way is fine</p>
<p>If you are going to correct me: (do it privately or do it in front of the class or other) any way is fine</p>
<p>If you are going to tell me I'm doing something wrong, phrase it this way:hey can you double check that to make sure it's right.</p>
<p>If you want to praise me: (do it privately or do it in front of the class or other) any way is fine</p>
<p>It is important to me that feedback is: (timely, includes specific examples, is constructive...etc) able to help both me and others who might do the same</p>
